Assignment 1:

Note that each team member created branches to work on specific tasks. I focused on the GameComponent branch within the Video Game Catalog and client project.

Step 1: Unit Testing in the GameCard Component In the GameCard component, I conducted unit testing to ensure the accurate processing of the game card. I've also tested scenarios where images had incorrect typing and verified that the component handled them correctly by passing a number instead of a string to the game card component.

Step 2: Integration Testing in the Slider Component I performed integration testing in the Slider component to confirm that multiple game cards were rendered correctly. Additionally, I checked if the component simulated a click event accurately when a user interacted with specific game cards. Moreover, I tested scenarios where some game cards had images with incorrect types. I ensured that the number of correctly rendered images matched the number of game cards with the correct image type.

Step 3: I did End-to-End Testing for the main landing page, where I conducted end-to-end testing to simulate the user experience of interacting with the page. While my teammates focused on testing the API, I used mock data for testing purposes. I specifically tested the user experience of clicking on a game card and expected a modal to appear with relevant information from the selected game. Furthermore, I simulated clicking the close button on the modal to remove it from the screen. Then I tested clicking on the view more to bring me to the search page where I again select a different game card to ensure that the modal displayed the correct information.
